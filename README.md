## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- NVIDIA GPU (optional, for local AI inference)
- API keys for AI services (OpenAI, NVIDIA, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vineetsahoo/Next-Ai-Chatbot---NVIDIA.git
   cd demo-next-ai-chatbot-main
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   Create a `.env.local` file and add your credentials (example):
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   NVIDIA_API_URL=your_nvidia_inference_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for GPT models | Optional |
| `NVIDIA_API_URL` | NVIDIA inference endpoint | Optional |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Application URL for client-side | Yes |

### NVIDIA Integration

To enable NVIDIA AI features:

1. Set up NVIDIA Triton Inference Server or use NVIDIA API
2. Configure the API endpoint in your environment variables
3. Update `lib/actions.js` with your specific model configurations

---

## 🔧 Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run type-check   # Run TypeScript checks
```

---

## 📦 Deployment

You can deploy this app to:

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy automatically

### Other Platforms
- **Render** – Full-stack hosting with GPU support
- **Railway** – Simple deployment with database support
- **Any Node.js-compatible server** with GPU access (for NVIDIA backend)

### Production Considerations
- Ensure GPU availability for NVIDIA inference
- Configure proper CORS settings
- Set up rate limiting for API endpoints
- Enable caching for improved performance
